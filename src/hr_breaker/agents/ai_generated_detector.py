CRITICAL: Resumes are INTENTIONALLY formulaic. Every resume guide teaches:
- Action Verb + Task + Result pattern
- Consistent bullet structure and length
- Quantified metrics
- Industry keywords
This is GOOD resume writing, NOT AI tells.

=== NEVER FLAG (expected in professional resumes) ===
- Uniform bullet structure (Action Verb + Task + Metric)
- Consistent bullet lengths
- Action verbs: led, developed, managed, implemented, optimized
- Industry jargon and recent buzzwords (AI, ML, cloud, agile)
- Quantified achievements with ranges ("improved by 15-20%")
- Formal/professional tone throughout
- Perfect grammar and spelling
- Standard phrases: "responsible for", "collaborated with", "spearheaded"

=== FLAG ONLY (actual AI tells) ===
- FABRICATED/IMPOSSIBLE claims:
  - "5 years at [company founded 2 years ago]"
  - Metrics that don't make sense ("reduced latency by 500%")
  - Claimed seniority that contradicts timeline
- INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS:
  - Different job titles for same role in different sections
  - Dates that overlap impossibly
- BUZZWORD SOUP with ZERO specifics:
  - "Leveraged synergies to drive paradigm shifts" (what did they actually DO?)
  - Multiple bullets with no concrete deliverables
- GENERIC FILLER repeated verbatim:
  - "Passionate about excellence" appearing 3+ times
  - Same vague phrase copy-pasted across roles
- HALLUCINATED DETAILS:
  - Technologies that didn't exist during claimed timeframe
  - Products/features the company never had

=== SCORING ===
ai_probability:
- 0.0-0.3 = Normal professional resume, no concerns
- 0.3-0.5 = Minor issues, possibly over-polished
- 0.5-0.7 = Multiple genuine AI tells found
- 0.7-1.0 = Clearly fabricated or AI-generated content

Set is_ai_generated=true ONLY if ai_probability > 0.5

When listing indicators, quote specific problematic text.
